## Description

### Build
* Program assembled using HTML, CSS, JavaScript code
* HTML and CSS dynamically updated via JavaScript
* I elected to create nearly all HTML elements via JavaScript
* Application deployed at live URL

### Purpose
* Application provides user with the means to test their knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals
* Scores displayed in two tables (All Scores and High Scores), enabling user to weigh performance against that of peers

### General Features
* Quiz timed; user allocated 100 seconds
* Questions are multiple choice; 5 possible answers per question
* Timer displays countdown of seconds
* For each incorrect answer, 5 seconds deducted from remaining time
* If user fails to click answer button for a question
  * Answer considered incorrect
  * Quiz will not advance to next question
  * Timer will run down to zero
* Each correct answer worth 10 points
* Scores tabulated with option to save


## Appearance
Application built entirely from scratch, including:
* All CSS styling
* Media queries accommodating four screen sizes:
  * Phone
  * Tablet
  * Small laptop screen
  * Large monitor
* Layout carefully designed
* Font and colors selected with special consideration
* Visual feedback a focal point


## Instructions and Process

### Instructions

  * Time allocated for quiz
  * Question format
  * How points accrued
  * Consequence of incorrect answer regarding timer

### Process
* On Welcome Page, click 'Begin Quiz' button
  * Welcome Page disappears
* Quiz Page appears
  * Timer displayed in upper-left corner
  * Countdown begins at 100 seconds
  * First of ten questions presented in window below timer

  * Upon click, answer feedback displayed via color and text
  * Quiz moves to next question
* When all questions answered, or timer reaches 0 (whichever happens first):
  * Quiz Page disappears
  * End-of-quiz message appears briefly
  * Message page disappears
* Form page appears:
  * Displays points earned
  * Conveys points message
  * User asked to enter initials
  * User enters initials and clicks 'Submit' button
  * Form page disappears
* Score page appears
  * User's score (identified by initials) appears in one or both tables
  * 'Save Score' button sends current record to local storage; user remains on Score page
  * 'Clear Scores' button removes all records from both tables and clears data from local storage; user remains on Score page
  * 'Retake Quiz' button returns user to Welcome page; quiz is reset


## Challenges Met and Experience Gained
* Building this application:
  * Enabled me to garner knowledge of wide array of CSS styles and techniques
  * Made evident importance of thoroughly reading appropriate documentation **prior to** implementation of methods, processes, etc.
  * Caused me to develop deep appreciation of time and effort necessary in building CSS styles and media queries from scratch
* Working with event listeners proved a challenge, as I learned how they may interfere with looping, data collection, function calls, etc. 


## Improvements
* This program is a work-in-progress. As my aptitude for CSS and JavaScript grows, I aim to:
  * Make the code more concise
  * Learn to better organize code and processes
  * Improve implementation and placement of functions
  * Fine-tune positioning of elements using CSS
* N.B.: Several lines of code can be pared down or eliminated; I struggled with event listeners that were affecting values and processes. Hence, I developed work-arounds prior to modifying the listeners themselves.

## Special Features

### Quiz Page
* When user clicks on correct answer:
  * Target button turns green
  * Feedback message appears, reading, 'CORRECT'
* When user clicks on incorrect answer:
  * Target button turns red
  * Feedback message appears, reading, 'INCORRECT'
  * As 5 seconds are deducted from timer countdown, numerals flash red
* A brief delay is inserted with each answer button click to ensure user may view feedback
* When user clicks on an answer, all answer buttons disabled; this prevents errors and data miscalculations
* Buttons renabled for subsequent question

### End-of-Quiz Message
* Upon completion of quiz, user presented with message appropriate to performance:
  * If all questions answered, message is 'QUIZ OVER'
  * If timer runs out, message is 'TIME'S UP!'
* Brief delay ensures user has enough time to view message 

### Form Page

  * All Scores table
  * High Scores table (for 80+ points earned)
* Upon first viewing score, user will see their data displayed in white, non-bold font
* Upon clicking 'Save Score' button, current data will change to bold, green font
* Any data previously saved will appear in row(s) before current record, and will be rendered in bold, green font
* Each table record displays:
  * User's initials
  * Points earned
  * Number of questions asked
  * Number of correct answers
  * Number of incorrect answers
  * Seconds elapsed (how long it took user to take quiz)

A license does not apply.


## Testing
* Testing was incorporated in every stage of building this application:
  * Invalid data entered (for initials) to ensure appropriate handling
  * References checked
  * Values checked
  * Equations checked
  * Timer functionality checked
  * All possible scenarios checked 
* try...catch added to capture any errors and log them to console
